## Project Description

join-deliberate is a frontend project that access an external API and provide a search engine to find content about health. 

## Project Motivation

This project is a code assessment to show knowleadge of React and code best practices. 

## Project Funcionalities (how to call this item? user experience?)

The project is divided in two major aspects: search and healthTopics. The search care about the search engine. And healthTopics care about the results and how to display them.

* the user can search for health content by typing a keyword using the search input. 

* while the user is typing, the app will suggest some words to facilitate the typing process and also to give some guesses about what subjects can be found. The user has the option to use them or not. 

* after performing the search, the results will be visible on the page with the following pattern: 

    - every result will be a specific card. This card will have a title, categories, related items and sections(articles).

    - the related items and sections(articles) are shown as buttons (to minimized or expand their contents) to improve the page's organization and visibility. 

    - sections (articles) are the content itself. They are the text's linked to that specific Title and Categories. Inside of them, the user will find a subtitle and another button to minimized or expand the content. 

    - related items are made by a title and a link. This link move the user to another page (out from the app) to access content that could be familiar with the subject they are searching.
